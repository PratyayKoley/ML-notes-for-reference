# Types of ML

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning : Providing a supervision in terms of labels

The ML algorithm learns from the labelled data.

- We provide images of apples and mangoes and tell the model that these are images of apples and these are of mangoes.  
`apples and mangoes are labelled data`  
- When we provide a new image to the model it predicts and tells us it is an image of apple or a mango.

### Unsupervised Learning : Unlabelled data

The ML algorithm learns from the unlabelled data.

- We provide bunch of images of apples and mangoes together.
- Algorithm finds the pattern by matching them and prediction is that it groups them in 2 groups.  
  `Group 1 - Apples`  
  `Group 2 - Mangoes`  
- When we provide a new image to the model it predicts and tells us it is an image of Group 1 or Group 2.

### Reinforcement Learning : Agents take actions to get rewards

The ML algorithm is concerned with how intelligent agens take actions in an environment to maximize its rewards.

There are 4 aspects to understand this :  
1. Environment
2. Agent
3. Action
4. Reward

- Autonomous Cars and automatic drones.
- Consider a chess game played by a computer  
  Here,  
  `Environment = Chess Board`  
  `Agent = Computer`  
  `Action = Move played by computer`  
  `Reward = Win the game`  
- Computer needs to take the best actions *(moves)* which will benefit it to win the game. 
- Each action will give positive rewards or negative rewards. If it gets positive rewards, it is close to winning and if it gets negative rewards, it means the step or move was bad.
